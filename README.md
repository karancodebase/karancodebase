## it's jaydatt - codes weird, ships real

Started with a curiosity for breaking things on the internet, now building something on top of it.  
full-stack dev turned product person, turned founder who still codes like itâ€™s 2am in a hoodie.

currently building in public, learning in loops, and always one deploy away from dopamine.

Whether it's crafting onchain social platforms like [BuddyFi](https://www.buddyfi.xyz), turning GitHub streaks into NFTs with Devira, or building AI agents that think with you - my focus is simple: **Ship fast. Build bold. Stay weird.**

Iâ€™ve always followed one rule:  **If it excites me, I build it.**

### tools in my backpack

next.js â€¢ rust â€¢ tailwind â€¢ solana  
and a strong dislike for bloated apps.


### now

building stuff that feels like play but solves real problems.  
rewriting, refining, and releasing - fast.  
sometimes alone, sometimes with a crew. always shipping.

> code, chai aur community - bas isi mein jeevan safal hai.

> open to collabs, chaos, and coffee-fueled builds.
